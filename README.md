## üôã‚Äç What's *this*?
Good question, amigo. Well, this is a GitHub repository which stores and hosts the code I created for this small *currency denominations* project. Add and remove coins (play G-d) to experiment with the efficiency of your hypothetical economy in which the coins you chose exist solely. The average number of coins used per transaction in your economy is displayed in the right-side panel. That number is calculated by my algorithm, which creates a distribution by finding the amount of coins, from your economy, that it takes to pay for each instance of change (1 cent to 100 cents) and finds the average between them all.

## ü§© Inspiration
I saw a video by Vsauce2 in my recommended on 6/24/19 called *The McNugget Number*. Like always, a very well executed video by Kevin. I was very curious about the concepts that Kevin discussed in the video, such as the Frobenius Number and the Greedy Algorithm. I thought to myself that it would be a fun coding challenge to make a greedy algorithm in my favorite programming language, JavaScript. I got it working pretty quickly and then I felt the inspiration to do a little more and then a little more and a little more. I ended up making a whole interface for simulating economies that uses different values for coined currency. I didn't use any frameworks and the entire project was done with pure JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I am *not* a designer so the site is not styled to perfection (sorry in about my boring designs). I think it took me about 3 hours to complete this. It was a pretty neat, little project to spend some time on. I hope you like it!
